# CRUD API

Another part of my 'Done in a day' project, this test 'REST API / CRUD API' was good fun and easy to make! 
Next up will be a database using Mongo DB in a bid to enter the full stack space within the coming year.

# Made using:
- Node.Js
- Express.Js
- UUID
- Postman (API development software)
